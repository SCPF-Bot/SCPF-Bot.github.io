### Dear Babii,

Sorry I forgot to write this yesterday but let me write this again like I'm writing this in this date. So today a lot has happened. First I dreamed about you again, it's a very long dream about you and me being together. When I woke up, I found myself having tears because of it. I find it pitiful that I'm even shedding tears when I'm dreaming...

Today I also messaged you using my dummy account. I messaged you about all of my thoughts again. I did message you because I suddenly realized it all again. I realized that maybe, just maybe, maybe God made us meet each other for us to be an unforgettable lesson for the both of us. Until now I'm having tears while writing this diary. All I ever wanted is to say to you that I love you when my final moments come. I wish you would take care of Boba the second for me. I can't continue writing this today, my chest hurts so bad that I wish I could go back to the night we met. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
