### Dear Babii,

Good evening and thank you. Thank you for inviting and adding me as a friend earlier in a game. If you could just see how happy I was that time. Before that, let's start with the morning. So after I woke up, I remember that I dreamed of something. My dream is you, yeah, you again. I forgot the details but the only thing that I can remember is we're talking to each other and you're smiling. I miss that smile of yours...

For this afternoon or evening, I opened my account in my game planning to see if you saw my comments on your photo album and also to play classic mode. Just as I am sending recruitment invitation, I was surprised that your account popped up in my friend list. Like huh? Am i dreaming? My heartbeat started to rise up because of both joy and shock. Thank you again for inviting me for us to play a match. But just how my story works, every happiness merely ends to sadness. After I logged out and took a rest for a while, I logged in back and got welcomed by an unending truth that you've unfriended me again. It made me sad, really. Tonight I just wanna see your face again before I sleep so I will visit your photos soon to ease my melancholic part of me. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
