### Dear Babii,

Hi, it's me, starting this diary. At first I find this boring but as the time pass by, I slowly realize that it's marvelous. Let's skip the introduction and go straight to the point. Okay, so this morning I have dream, and it's three dreams. The first one is kinda funny because it's about me, cooking an ordinary burger with so many patties on it and I called it a Krabby Patti. My second dream is about you, yeah, you. We're talking to each other. And my third dream is about me, cleaning some floor in our house back on the province. Honestly, I forgot the chronological order of my dreams this night but it doesn't matter. Now moving forward, this day I have tonsillitis so I barely made any household chores right now because yeah, I have fever. But today I'm kinda grateful, I don't know if this is right to feel but it made me happy that you visited my account in a specific game. I don't know if it's by accident or something but it made me happy. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
