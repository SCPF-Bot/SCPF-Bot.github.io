### Dear Babii,

Today I dreamed about you. The dream is about us, talking through messenger, like a voice call. As far as I can remember, I'm crying in that dream while convincing you to stop doing specific things. I remember that you also said to me there that the texts (messages) and numbers (mobile numbers) are already spreading. Honestly, I really have no clue what that all means but one thing's for sure, I'm crying because it's all about something bad...

Today I messaged you again in Facebook using my dummy account. Maybe you don't feel it but you made me have a little glee when you asked me to play a game with you. It makes me sad that I have to turn that down because I feel unusual today but that doesn't mean I don't want to. It's just that I need rest now and will be okay later. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
