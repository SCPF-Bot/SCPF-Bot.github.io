### Dear Babii,

If you're reading this, I miss you, really. So today I'm fully recovered already so I started to work myself out a bit today. I really really miss you right now that I'm planning to even search you in Telegram. I know this may sound selfish but I'm trying to find you there to get more information about you. I tried using Telegram tonight but ended with a fail. I'm struggling to login an account and it makes me a bit unease. I hope you're okay, like you're doing just fine this past few days. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
