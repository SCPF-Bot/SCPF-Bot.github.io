Today I visited your profile Babs and made me contemplate a lot about the past. I'm really sorry Babii if ever that you feel being blamed by me over what downfall happened to me. Because honestly speaking, I'm too weak that time that my feelings got crumbled by what I saw. Now I totally understood it but I hope that my self that time overcame it a lot sooner so what I am right now didn't happen at all...

Until now Babii I always wish that someday, when it's my end, when I'm in my thirties, I'll be back to the time when you came to see me at the airport. Maybe that time I'll do all the things right. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

I always wish that I got blind temporarily that time so you didn't endure that poverty. I love you Babii, sorry...
