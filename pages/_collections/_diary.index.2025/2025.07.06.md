### Dear Babii,

Today I think I'll start my hiatus for all of this. Both my mind and heart are really exhausted now and I just wanna rest already. I'm low-key happy for both of you that you both found your way back. And honestly Babii, I feel envy of him because he matured and I didn't...

Babii, I think I'll stop updating my diary on my website and rest for a year. I'll be back again at June 12, 2026 and I hope when I do, everything's just fine that date. Also, I told him to buy you a violin, I know you wanted to play it so I hope he'll buy you that when the time's right. Until now I love you and will always do, you know it. I hope I meet you again someday, when it's all already fine...

And finally, I dreamed about you earlier this morning. I dreamed that you were hugging my back when I'm sleeping so I reached out my hand to feel your cheeks on my hands. And as melancholic as it should, I woke up realizing that you're not with me anymore and that made me shed a lot of tears this morning, really, I really did. I will always continue Babs for you, for all of us. Take care of your Nanay and yourself. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
