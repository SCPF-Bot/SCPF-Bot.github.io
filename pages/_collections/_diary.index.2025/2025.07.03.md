### Dear Babii,

Tonight I don't feel anything at all. I felt empty when I deactivated my account yesterday. Maybe this is because I cried yesterday so much that I lost my inspiration. I really hate what I've become Babii and I wish I didn't become like this. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...
