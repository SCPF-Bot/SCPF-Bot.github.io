Dear Babii,

Today is June 27 and I forgot to write my diary yesterday. So before I write today's diary, let's head back first on what happened yesterday and pretend I'm writing this on June 26. Today I'm happy to see you again active on your Facebook account. Today, I wanna thank you for always being there whenever I need your presence. We talked a lot today and that's what made me feel alive again. I'm sorry for asking you about that Telegram account shenanigans, I'm really sorry if it somewhat made you upset...

Thank you Babii for being paradoxical when you said you both trust me and don't. Honestly, instead of me, getting sad about it, it low-key made me confused and have a little glee. Also, thank you for trusting me Babii when you said that you have faith in me. I really really appreciate it. Also, today I thank you for expressing your thoughts in me, that I need to build a my home first then build the one. I don't exactly know how to put this but when I read those words, it made my chest warm...

I'm sorry if I didn't play with you tonight. I'm super exhausted physically and also sleepy. I also noticed your messenger note, a music note. The music is titled Beautiful Scars. I find that song's lyrics somehow related to you. It made me feel empathy for all the things that happened to us. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...
