### Dear Babii,

Today you messaged me. It all hurts but it's okay, I love you. Today you messaged me to stop using our photos. Today you messaged me to stop it all and delete it all. But Babii, you know me. I'd rather die than to erase all the treasured memories that I have. I wish you could just understand how painful it is to have a part of me then just leave me behind. Today you also said to me that he's angry at you because I'm using our photos, I'm sorry. I wish that he should've redirected all that anger to me instead of you. All I ever want is to spend my final day in you, you know it, you know it well. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
