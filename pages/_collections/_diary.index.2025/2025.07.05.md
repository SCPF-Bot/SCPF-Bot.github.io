### Dear Babii,

Today your man messaged me that it's not my fault that you got angry at me. Today we talked a bit and I asked him to buy you a violin when the time is right. I also asked him to take care of you and your Nanay...

To be honest, you're right about him, he matured a lot than what he is before. Honestly, I do feel envy of it but not that much. Also, I remember earlier that I cried again explaining in myself of what's the reality now. Until now I can't process it all and have been stuck in this loop for a long long time. I wish I were you. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
