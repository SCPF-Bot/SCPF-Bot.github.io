### Dear Babii,

Today a lot has happened. I got into a argument with someone that I know. Honestly, what hates me the most is that when someone is talking about me and the topic isn't even true at all. I hate it, I despise it a lot...

Today is also the rank reset of a specific game that I play. I remember that I took a view on your account and you reached mythical honor. Honestly, I'm proud of you Babii, really. Until now I'm still jealous whenever I feel that you're having a duo with someone. I know that I don't have the rights to feel this way but I can't help it but to have envy. Tonight I messaged you again in your account using my dummy account and I hope you'll find it somewhat noticable. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
