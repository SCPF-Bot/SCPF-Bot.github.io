### Dear Babii,

Good evening Babs, today is one of my bad days, for real. So to start, I woke up early this day around 4 AM? I don't know what time is it but after I woke up, I tried to play Mobile Legends. Later on, I ate the leftover noodles and meat loaf from last night which is unheated. Then it all started to happen...

The first thing that happened is my teeth, yeah my teeth. While eating, I'm starting to feel the toothache. That hurts, really, but that's not the end. After a while, I started to get headache because my toothache somehow connects to my left side of my head...

Now the fun begins, after that, I started to get dizzy and boom, I vomited all the food that I ate earlier. Why? Because I forgot to eat dinner last night and went straight to the unheated food which is technically bad for me, I guess. My gosh, the floor earlier is on a mess because I vomited two times. After that, I went to the bathroom to continuously vomit all the remaining foods, and deym, that experience is hell. Just hold on, there's next...

After that vomiting, ah hell nah, my stomach started to get crazy, like really wild. I think I suffered diarrhea or something else because my tummy hurts so bad that I can't even stand nor open both of my eyes. That took almost forever that I am really relieved that it's finally over after enduring it for almost two freaking hours...

After a while, I started to get some rest and as usual, visit your Facebook profile. I can't eat much until now because my tummy is still acting crazy and I hope that it'll be over soon...

And Babii, do you know that I didn't even notice that it's already June 11? I'm like what? Already? I also heard that tonight there will be strawberry moon or maybe it's a blood moon, I don't know...

I also finished preparing the video that I made and I really really really hope that you'll view it. I'll post it on my main account tomorrow and I do hope that you'll understand that until now and forever, you will always be that person that I adore the most. I hope you're doing just fine Babii and you're taking care of your Nanay like I often remind you. I will continue writing this diary until I finally float off in the wind. I also wish that maybe someday, someday you'll appreciate the artwork that I made. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...
