### Dear Babii,

Today I cried a lot. I know it's wrong but I can't help myself but to recall all the memories we have. Until now it hurts me, it really do. But even after that, it still makes me happy that you fulfilled one of my wish. I'm kinda sad tonight that I'm thinking about my future, of what it will be. I wish you were here. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
