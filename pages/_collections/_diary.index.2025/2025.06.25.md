### Dear Babii,

Today I'm exhausted. After I got home today, I made myself rest already. I've done a lot today but I think it's better for me to just rest this night. I forgot to write yesterday that when I saw your note, a music note in messenger, I felt something warm and unusual inside my chest. It happened when my foolish self is having a mental breakdown yesterday that I said stupid things to you, that includes me, saying that I'll leave. The song in the note that I saw is Before You Go by Lewis Capaldi. That made me cry, really...

Also, I wanna thank you Babii for trusting me with all your heart. That alone makes me feel that I still have a purpose to continue. Today I saw you when I got home that you deactivated your account again. You deactivated both your Facebook and Messenger account. I wish I could see you right now to have you lean on me whenever you're feeling down. I know it won't really work but I still sent you some messages even though it can't be delivered. I hope you'll be okay Babii. Don't give up, trust your heart. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...
