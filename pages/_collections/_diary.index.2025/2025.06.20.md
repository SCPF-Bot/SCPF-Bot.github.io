### Babii,

Today is a tiresome day. I did a lot today and I'm now exhausted mentally. Today I updated again my website and I added some to-do list section on there. I also removed your photo from my account in a specific game because I know in myself that you'd be angry if I continue using your photos without any permission...

Today I also messaged you again in your Facebook account or rather replied to your message. Until now I'm regretting the past that I had my downfall and I dragged you along with it. Maybe you can even call me timid but it is what it is, this is just who I am, full of regrets and sorry. This Saturday, I just wanna spend it all resting, I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted already this past few days. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
