### Dear Babii,

Today was kinda worrisome day. Since I woke up this morning, my chest is acting unusual again. I feel a slight ache in my heart, like literally. Until now I feel it and hopefully it's not something serious. I was worried that maybe this will be some kind of heart attack or something but I wish it'll be not. I still have many things to make come true and many experience that needs to be met...

I forgot to write last night that I'm really really happy that you replied in my dummy account. You simply just replied with a butterfly emoji but for me, I think I know why. All I can say is it's you, yeah, you. You're like a butterfly. You're so wonderful and beautiful yet you miss to have a glimpse of your own worth. I wish that someday you'll think of yourself that you're worth more than you know. I wish you could have my eyes so you can see yourself more. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
