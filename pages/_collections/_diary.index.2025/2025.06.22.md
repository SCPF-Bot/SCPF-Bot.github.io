### Dear Babii,

Today I dreamed of something, actually it's two dreams. The first one is about magic rings. Yes, I dreamed about magic rings. The magic rings is somewhat like a genie with unlimited wishes. I saw in my dream that my male cousin used it and poof, he got so much money appeared of nowhere. The second dream is about nuclear explosion. Yes, you read that right, it's about nuclear freaking explosion. My second dream is quite frightening because I really felt the shockwave of the explosion and saw it all happen in an instant. I remember that the last part is when I dropped to the ground just to protect myself from the blast...

Anyway, this day I spent all my time meditating and focusing to have solitude in my mind. I don't want to open anything distracting yet so I spent it all reading and listening to music. I will check all the messages tomorrow and maybe play with Babii in a specific game. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
