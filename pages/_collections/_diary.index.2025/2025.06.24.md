### Dear Babii,

I want to start this by saying sorry to you because of what I did last night. To be honest, I still can't believe myself that I had an emotional breakdown last night and this morning. I'm sorry if you're the one who I always talk to whenever I experience this kind of behavior...

Today I'm also happy because you low-key comforted me today. I know it's not a lot but seeing you do small things for me without saying anything about it makes my chest feel your warmth. Earlier this morning, when I opened messenger, I saw your note. Maybe it's something different but for me, it's a little warmth that I feel through that...

Today I'm also happy that you played a game with me. Even though it all ended with a defeat, I still had a lot of fun with you. I don't really know about me but it always makes me wonder of how you can easily change my mood. All your small actions Babii makes me feel your presence and feel okay with it. Thank you for reminding me Babii to take care of myself, I would. Today a lot has happened and I'm kinda exhausted now so I'll take an early rest. Again, thank you Babii for always being there whenever I'm so down. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...
