### Dear Babii,

I'm still a bit dizzy now for I just woke up. Okay, so earlier I saw that you already blocked me on Instagram. I don't know how to feel anymore but I'm sure that what's left in my chest is only sadness. Today I messaged you instead using my dummy account in facebook. I know it's too much but I also made some reminders there for you to remember. Honestly, I don't feel like writing this diary tonight because of how sad I am. I guess that's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
