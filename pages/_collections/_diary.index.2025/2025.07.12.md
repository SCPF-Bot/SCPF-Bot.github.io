### Dear Babii,

I just arrived home tonight. I'm pretty sure exhausted walking. It's kinda funny Babs because today I already lost count of how many times I've visited your profile. I also recalled some of our memories. It made me happy that you made my wish come true, for you to come to me. I just wish I could have seven loops of year 2024. I wish you were here. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
