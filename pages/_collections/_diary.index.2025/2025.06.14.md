### Dear Babii,

Thank you for talking to me on Instagram, I know that it made me feel sad but also happy because you talked to me this night. I don't know why you Mama have around five hundred thousand debt but I hope she's okay. You also said that she's missing but maybe she's just doing something important. It pains me to know that you're not okay now and you told me that it's like hell. I hope you'll be okay soon Babii. Honestly, I really really really want to write every details of happening today but there's a lot that happened so I can't think straight right now. I guess that's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
