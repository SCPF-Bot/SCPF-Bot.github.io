### Dear Babii,

Earlier today I dreamed about us. My dream is about me returning back your belongings that I still have with me. That includes your clothes and my very treasured hairpin. Honestly, it made me sad, really, because I don't want to return the hairpin to you. It's been an exhausting day today and I really want to just rest with your presence. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

Also, I created a Facebook featured story last night. I think I won't be using my account until next year. I don't know what to do anymore. I just wish I could just rest for good already...
