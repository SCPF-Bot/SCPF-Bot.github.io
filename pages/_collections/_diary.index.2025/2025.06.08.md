### Dear Babii,

Today I dreamed of a nightmare, A truly terrifying nightmare if you ask me...

The first nightmare is about me, seeing some people having a fight. As  I've watched them, suddenly some of them started running towards me and I panicked too. After a brief moment, I felt hot and dizzy. I really really know in myself that I got shot by a gun. My vision fainted as I struggled to reach a gate beside me, that's all...

The second nightmare is about me killing a girl. I'm scared of myself right now, really...

Then finally, the third nightmare is about me, killing a witness. Yeah, it's connected to my second nightmare and I got caught and punished by the law. I think the moral lesson about those dreams is that I should see the bigger picture whenever a good guy is trying to act bad forcefully...

That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
