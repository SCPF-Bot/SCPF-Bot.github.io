### Dear Babii,

Ahm, nothing to tell you much. Today I'm kind of recovering from my fever and my tonsillitis is still in there, but unlike before, it's better now. I forgot to mention before that I'm watching an anime and it's kinda relating to my mental health that much. I'll tell you the title someday, but until then, be sure to always smile. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
