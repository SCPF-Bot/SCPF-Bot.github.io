### Dear Babii,

Good evening, I just woke up. I've slept half a day today. My fever is still here and I'm doing my best to recover as fast as possible. I remember, I dreamed of something earlier. I dreamed about me, riding a ridiculous device that's made out of fiction. As far as I remember, it's like a surfboard or hoverboard but for flying. And the cherry on top of it is I'm riding with Kuya Kim (from Matang Lawin). All I did today was to rest and nothing more. That's it for today. I love you Babii, always...

\- Ange
