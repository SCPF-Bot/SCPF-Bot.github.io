### Dear Babii,

Last night I dreamed about something about you and me. My dream is about me visiting your profile. I know it's kinda normal but there's something more. While I'm visiting your profile, I accidentally made an interaction with your account. Up until now, I'm hiding this dummy account on you so I can keep watching you from afar. I made an interaction with your account and I don't know if I accidentally messaged you or reacted to your post. At that point of my dream, I got scared, really. I'm scared that you'll block this account and I won't be able to look at yourself anymore. I'm sorry Babii if I fell down, I never even wanted for me to be like this, really. I wish I could just be back again to the time that we met at the airport. I'm sorry. That's it for today's diary. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
