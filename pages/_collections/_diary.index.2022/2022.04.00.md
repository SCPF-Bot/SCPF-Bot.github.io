### Dear Babii,

This is the month when I left you. Until now I'm blaming myself for letting you go. There is so much for me to say but I can't, all I can do is cry whenever I remember this, when I remember your reason that you already got violated by another person sexually, when you desperately tried to tell me, and when you can't bring up yourself whenever I fall for you. Until now, I, my present self, blames myself for it all...

I remember that it's around the month of June when I'm diagnosed that I lack of potassium when I got hospitalized. I regret it all, I regret it that when I came back, I already saw you being happy with someone else. It hurt me, really. I love you Babii, sorry...

\- Ange
